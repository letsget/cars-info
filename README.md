## The project fetches cars from an API

#### This was a test assignment from a company, I don't really remember.

I did it a long ago and now decided to clean it up and make it look presentable.
The functionality is simple:

- HTML/CSS layout using styled components
- Fetching cars with Redux
- Using Redux for all actions in the app
- The functionality cannot be more simple, there's not much to talk about
